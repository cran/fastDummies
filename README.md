Overview
--------

The goal of fastDummies is to quickly create dummy variables (columns) and dummy rows. Creating dummy variables is possible through base R or other packages, but this package is much faster than those methods.

Installation
------------

``` r
To install this package, use the code
install.packages("fastDummies")


# The development version is available on Github.
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jacobkap/fastDummies")
```

Usage
-----

``` r
library(fastDummies)
```

There are two functions in this package:

-   `dummy_cols()` lets you make dummy variables (`dummy_columns()` is a clone of `dummy_cols()`)
-   `dummy_rows()` which lets you make dummy rows.
